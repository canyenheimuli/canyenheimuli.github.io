y2artisan is open source package of data visualization tools that I regularly contribute to and help maintain for Y2 Analytics. The package is a large suite of functions that can quickly render charts inside an R session, and also automatically generate PowerPoint documents with charts and writing placed on them in specified locations. These functions are wrappers for functions in the ggplot2, mscharts, and officeR R libraries.

See the source code [here](https://github.com/y2analytics/y2artisan).
