y2weights is an open source statistical analysis package which I took the lead on developing, regularly contribute to, and currently help maintain for Y2 Analytics. The package is a suite of helper functions and tools that assist users in survey/other data weighting and post-stratification. The functions in the package depend on R's "survey" statistical analysis package which uses a weighting algorithm called iterative proportional fitting (also known as raking). These functions can be used to weight data to specified levels of one variable, or multiple variables at once.

See the source code [here](https://github.com/y2analytics/y2weights).
