y2clerk is an open source statistical analysis package which regularly I contribute to and help maintain for Y2 Analytics. The package is a suite of statistical analysis functions, and it includes simple tabulation functions, a function to conduct multiple statistical significance tests of grouped contingency tables, and a function to automate questionnaire programming in Qualtrics.

See the source code [here](https://github.com/y2analytics/y2clerk).
