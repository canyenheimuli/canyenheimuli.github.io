Data Scientist and current Sr. Analyst at Y2 Analytics; currently in the market research consulting industry.

About Me:
======
My current work is focused on consultation specifically in the survey and market research domains. Some of the research and consulting projects I've led and worked on include public opinion research, focus groups, in-depth interviews, product analytics, pricing analysis, brand analysis, and market segmentation. My work typically includes cutting-edge analytical methods such as A/B and hypothesis testing, message testing, defining new metrics, predictive modeling, automating reports, machine learning, and data visualization. Recently, I have also been experimenting with the effectivness of using generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) as a workflow for more quickly processing and analyzing large amounts of open-end question survey responses.

One area of my work that I'm especially proud of is the work we do for municipal and city governments in the state of Utah. I have worked with countless local governments and even school boards to analyze various aspects of resident life, such as overall quality of life, the state of parks and recreation facilities, cost of living concerns, and residents' views on various political issues. These projects typically include using data from multiple different sources, such as our survey data typically collected through primary research, but also census data, state voter file data, and government data on economic indicators. This is one area where we have developed especially high-standard, efficient practices and technologies for turning data into actionable insights to improve people's lives.

I recently graduated with a Masters of Science in Analytics from Georgia Tech with an emphasis on computational tools (and I also have a B.A. in International Relations with a focus on econometrics). My masters coursework included general courses in statistical and predictive modeling, computer science, marketing and finance for data analysts; and also included more track-focused coursework in big data tools, machine learning, simulation, database design and data modeling, and knowledge-based artificial intelligence. In my final practicum project, I created a neural network based model that predicted various stock price movements by combining both classical stock market indicators with news data from Yahoo Finance for a large investment research firm.

Despite my work and education, I wasn't always in data science! During my college years, I developed an interest in humanitarian work, international nonprofits, and nonprofit management. I became deeply interested in and began taking classes in nonprofit management and structures of nonprofit organizations, impact analysis, and social enterprise ventures, and thought I would go on to work at a place like USAID or a large foundation. Though I didn't end up working in nonprofit management, I held onto my admiration of mission-driven organizations who take their social and environmental responsibilities seriously.

In my free time, I enjoy hiking, reading, playing video games, and collecting houseplants; and I'm also learning how to knit.
