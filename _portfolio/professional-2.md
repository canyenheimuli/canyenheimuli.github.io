y2weights is open source package of functions and tools for survey/other data weighting and post-stratification. The functions in the package depend on R's "survey" statistical analysis package which uses a weighting algorithm called iterative proportional fitting (also known as raking). I took the lead on developing, regularly contribute to, and currently help maintain this package for Y2 Analytics.

See the source code [here](https://github.com/y2analytics/y2weights).
