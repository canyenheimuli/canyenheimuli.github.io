In this project, I use SQL to run some simple queries on a sample database provided by Microsoft: The AdventureWorks Sample Database. The database is a collection of simple  tables of synthetic data about a bike parts manufacturer arranged with a simple schema. It can be hosted on a cloud server and accessed with an online database driver to practice SQL queries which is what I do in this project.
