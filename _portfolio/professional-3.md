y2artisan is open source package of data visualization functions that can quickly render charts inside an R session, and also automatically generate PowerPoint documents with charts and writing placed on them in specified locations. The functions are wrappers for functions in the ggplot2, mscharts, and officeR R libraries. I regularly contribute to and help maintain this package for Y2 Analytics.

See the source code [here](https://github.com/y2analytics/y2artisan).
