y2clerk is an open source package of statistical analysis functions, including functions for tabulating and getting summary statistics of variables in a dataset, conducting statistical significance tests of grouped contingency tables, and automating questionnaire programming in Qualtrics. I regularly contribute to and help maintain this package for Y2 Analytics.

See the source code [here](https://github.com/y2analytics/y2clerk).
