This project is about making a machine learning model to predict house prices. In this project, I create and evaluate a number of different models that use different algorithms, and compare and constrast their various results. The data used for this project is that of the Kaggle competition [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview).

See the full analysis [here](https://github.com/canyenheimuli/Predicting-Home-Values-with-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Housing%20Price%20Prediction.ipynb).
