In this project, I build and compare a number of classification models for a basic task: categorizing hand-drawn digits. This is one of the most basic "practice" machine learning projects data science practitioners go through to get exposure all sorts of model types, especially to neural networks, which are a focus of this project.

In addition to showing the predictive power and scalability of existing neural network libraries, I also examine this question: can a simpler model perform about as well as, or outperform a neural network for this complex computer vision problem?
