In this project, I tested several machine learning models to predict house prices. In this project, I created and evaluated a number of different models that use different algorithms, and compare and constrast their various results. The data used for this project came from the Kaggle competition [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview).
